                <h3 className='p-3'>4. What is the purpose of jwt and how does it work</h3>
                <p><span className='fw-bold fs-5'>Answer : </span>JWT, or JSON Web Token, is an open value that is used to share security information between two parties - a client and a server. Each JWT contains an encoded JSON object, which contains a set of claims. JWT is signed using a cryptographic algorithm so that claims cannot be changed after the token has been issued.</p>
                <h5>Its Works : </h5>
                <p>JWTs differ from other web tokens in that they contain a set of claims. The claim is used to transmit information between the two parties. What these claims are depends on the use at hand. For example, a claimant may claim who issued the token, how long it was valid, or what permission was granted to the client.

                    A JWT is a string consisting of three parts, separated by dots (.) And sorted using base 64. In the most common serialization format, compact serialization, JWT looks something like this: xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz.

                    Once decoded, you get two JSON strings:

                    Header and payload.
                    Signature.
                    The JOSE (JSON Object Signing and Encryption) header contains token types - in this case JWT - and the signing algorithm.

                    Payload claims are 6 It appears as a JSON string, usually with no more than a dozen fields to keep the JWT compact. This information is usually used by the server to verify that the user has permission to perform the requested actions.

                    There are no mandatory claims for JWT, but overlaying standards can make claims mandatory. For example, when using JWT as a carrier access token under OAuth2.0, iss, sub, aud and exp must be present. Some are more common than others.

                    The signature confirms that the token has not been changed. The parties that create the JWT sign the title and payload in a confidential manner that is known to both the issuer and the recipient, or only with a private key known to the sender. When the token is used, the recipient verifies that the title and payload match the signature. </p>
